it be picture of boa constrictor in the act of swallow a animal
here be a copy of the drawing
in the book it say boa constrictor swallow their prey whole without chew it
after that they be not able to move and they sleep through the six month that they need for digestion
I ponder deeply over the adventure of the jungle
and after some work with a colour pencil I succeed in make my first draw
my drawing number one
it look something like this
I show my masterpiece to the grown-ups and ask they whether the drawing frighten they
I try the experiment of show he my drawing number one which I have always keep
my drawing be not a picture of a hat
it be a picture of a boa constrictor digest a elephant
they always need to have thing explain
my drawing number two look like this
that be why at the age of six I give up what might have be a magnificent career as a painter
I have be disheartened by the failure of my drawing number one and my drawing number two
grown-ups never understand anything by themselves and it be tiresome for child to be always and forever explain thing to they
so then I choose another profession and learn to pilot airplane
I have fly a little over all part of the world
it be true that geography have be very useful to I
at a glance I can distinguish china from arizona
if one get lose in the night such knowledge be valuable
in the course of this life I have have a great many encounter with a great many person who have be concern with matter of consequence
I have live great deal among grown-ups
I have see they intimately close at hand
and that have not much improve my opinion of they
whenever I meet one of they who seem to I at all clear-sighted
I would try to find out so if this be a person of true understanding
but whoever it be he would always say
that be a hat
then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictor or primeval forest or star
I would bring myself down to his level
I would talk to he about bridge and golf and politics and necktie
and the grow-up would be greatly please to have meet such a sensible man
so I live my life alone without anyone
i be more isolate than a shipwreck sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean
thus you can imagine my amazement at sunrise when I be awaken by a odd little voice
it say
if you please draw I a sheep
what
draw I a sheep
I jump to my feet completely thunderstruck
I blink my eye hard
I look carefully all around I
I saw a most extraordinary small person who stand there examine I with great seriousness
here you may see the good portrait that later I be able to make of he
but my drawing be certainly very much less charming than its model
that however be not my fault
now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eye fairly start out of my head in astonishment
remember I have crash in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabit region
and yet my little man seem neither to be straying uncertainly among the sand nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear
nothing about he give any suggestion of a child lose in the middle of the desert a thousand miles from any human habitation
when at last I be able to speak I say to he
but what be you do here
and in answer he repeat very slowly as if he be speak of a matter of great consequence
I have a accident with my plane in the desert of sahara six year ago
when a mystery be too overpowering one dare not disobey
he answer I
that do not matter draw I a sheep
but I have never draw a sheep so I draw for he one of the two picture I have draw so often
it be that of the boa constrictor from the outside
and I be astound to hear the little fellow greet it with
no no no I do not want a elephant inside a boa constrictor
a boa constrictor be a very dangerous creature and a elephant be very cumbersome
where I live everything be very small
what I need be a sheep
draw I a sheep
so then I make a drawing
he look at it carefully then he say
no this sheep be already very sickly
so I make another draw
my friend smile gently and indulgently
you see yourself he say that this be not a sheep
this be a ram
it have horn
so then I do my draw over once more
but it be reject too just like the others
this one be too old
I want a sheep that will live long time
by this time my patience be exhaust because I be in a hurry to start take my engine apart so I toss off this draw
this be only his box
the sheep you ask for be inside
I be very surprise to see a light break over the face of my young judge
that be exactly the way I want it
do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass
why
because where I live everything be very small
there will surely be enough grass for he I say
it be a very small sheep that I have give you
he bend his head over the draw
not so small that
look
he have go to sleep
and that be how I make the acquaintance of the little prince
it take I a long time to learn where he come from
the little prince who ask I so many question never seem to hear the one I ask he
it be from word drop by chance that little by little everything be reveal to I
the first time he saw my airplane
he ask I what be that object
that be not a object
it fly
it be a airplane
it be my airplane
I be proud to have he learn that I can fly
he cry out then
what
you drop down from the sky
yes I answer modestly
oh that be funny
and the little prince break into a lovely peal of laughter which irritate I very much
I like my misfortune to be take seriously
then he add
so you too come from the sky
which be your planet
do you come from another planet
but he do not reply
he toss his head gently without take his eye from my plane
it be true that on that you can not have come from very far away
and he sink into a reverie which last a long time
then take my sheep out of his pocket he bury himself in the contemplation of his treasure
you can imagine how my curiosity be arouse by this half-confidence about the other planet
I make a great effort therefore to find out more on this subject
my little man where do you come from
where I live
where do you want to take your sheep
after a reflective silence he answer
the thing that be so good about the box you have give I be that
at night he can use it as his house
that be so
and if you be good I will give you a string too so that you can tie he during the day and a post to tie he to
but the little prince seem shock by this offer
tie he
what a queer idea
but if you do not tie he I say he will wander off somewhere and get lose
my friend break into another peal of laughter
but where do you think he would go
anywhere
straight ahead of he
then the little prince say earnestly
that do not matter

and with perhaps a hint of sadness he add
straight ahead of he nobody can go very far
i have thus learn a second fact of great importance this be that the planet the little prince come from be scarcely any large than a house
but that do not really surprise I much
i know very well that in addition to the great planetssuch as the earth jupiter mars venusto which we have give name there be also hundred of others some of which be so small that one have a hard time see they through the telescope
when a astronomer discover one of this he do not give it a name but only a number
he might call it for example asteroid
i have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince come be the asteroid know as
this asteroid have only once be see through the telescope that be by a turkish astronomer
on make his discovery the astronomer have present it to the international astronomical congress in a great demonstration
but he be in turkish costume and so nobody would believe what he say
grown-ups be like that
fortunately however for the reputation of asteroid a turkish dictator make a law that his subject under pain of death should change to european costume
the astronomer give his demonstration all over again dress with impressive style and elegance
this time everybody accept his report
child should always show great forbearance toward grow-up person
but certainly for we who understand life figure be a matter of indifference
I should have like to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tale
I should have like to say once upon a time there be a little prince
who live on a planet that be scarcely any big than himself and who have need of a friend
to that who understand life that would have give a much great air of truth to my story
for I do not want any one to read my book carelessly
I have suffer too much grief in set down this memory
six year have already pass since my friend go away from I with his sheep
if I try to describe he here it be to make sure that I shall not forget he
to forget a friend be sad
not every one have have a friend
and if I forget he I may become like the grown-ups who be no long interest in anything but figure
it be for that purpose again that I have buy a box of paint and some pencil
it be hard to take up draw again at my age
I shall certainly try to make my portrait as true to life as possible
but I be not at all sure of success
one drawing go along all right and another have no resemblance to its subject
I make some error too in the little prince 's height
in one place he be too tall and in another too short
and I feel some doubt about the colour of his costume
so I fumble along as good I can now good now bad and I hope generally fair-to-middling
In certain more important detail I shall make mistake also
but that be something that will not be my fault
my friend never explain anything to I
but I alas do not know how to see sheep through the wall of box
perhaps I be a little like the grown-ups
I have have to grow old
the information would come very slowly as it might chance to fall from his thought
it be in this way that I hear on the third day about the catastrophe of the baobab
this time once more I have the sheep to thank for it
for the little prince ask I abruptlyas if seize by a grave doubt
it be true be not it that sheep eat little bush
yes that be true
ah I be glad
I do not understand why it be so important that sheep should eat little bush
but the little prince add
then it follow that they also eat baobab
the idea of the herd of elephant make the little prince laugh
we would have to put they one on top of the other he say
but he make a wise comment
before they grow so big the baobab start out by being little
that be strictly correct I say
but why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobab
he answer I at once oh come come as if he be speak of something that be self-evident
and I be oblige to make a great mental effort to solve this problem without any assistance
in consequence there be good seed from good plant and bad seed from bad plant
but seed be invisible
now there be some terrible seed on the planet that be the home of the little prince
and this be the seed of the baobab
the soil of that planet be infest with they
it spread over the entire planet
it bore clear through it with its root
and if the planet be too small and the baobab be too many they split it in piece
it be a question of discipline the little prince say to I later on
it be very tedious work the little prince add but very easy
that would be very useful to they if they be to travel some day
sometimes he add there be no harm in put off a piece of work until another day
but when it be a matter of baobab that always mean a catastrophe
i know a planet that be inhabit by a lazy man
he neglect three little bush
so as the little prince describe it to I I have make a drawing of that planet
i do not much like to take the tone of a moralist
child I say plainly watch out for the baobab
the lesson which I pass on by this means be worth all the trouble it have cost I
the reply be simple I have try but with the others I have not be successful
when I make the drawing of the baobab I be carry beyond myself by the inspire force of urgent necessity
er tostik meet bapy the snake king in the underground kingdom

such sensitivity tenderness characteristic of only a true princess
so the prince make haste to marry she because he know he have find a real princess

there it be still to be see unless somebody have take it
there that be a true story

there come a soldier marching down the high road-one
he have his knapsack on his back and his sword at his side
he come home from the war
on the road he meet a witch
she be ugly and unpleasant
good evening soldier witch say
the witch point to tree nearby they
climb to the top of the trunk and you'll find a hole
you notice through the hollow that inside of tree than large cave
it have three room in a cave
each room have a huge chest and it be guard by dog
i'll give you my apron to seat a dog in it
you can take money from chest
you shall bring I my remain tinder-box
i'll tie a rope around your middle
when you call I I can pull you up again
what would I do deep down under that tree the soldier want to know
fetch money the witch say
listen
when you touch bottom you'll find yourself in a great hall
it be very bright there because more than a hundred lamp be burn
by the light you will see three door
each door have a key in it so you can open they all
if you walk into the first room you'll see a large chest in the middle of the floor
on it sit a dog and his eye be as big as saucer
but do not worry about that
i'll give you my blue check apron to spread out on the floor
snatch up that dog and set he on my apron
then you can open the chest and take out as many piece of money as you please
they be all copper
but if silver suit you good then go into the next room
there sit a dog and his eye be as big as mill wheel
but do not you care about that
set the dog on my apron while you change your pocket with silver
maybe you'd rather have gold
you can you know
you can have all the gold you can carry if you go into the third room
the only hitch be that there on the money-chest sit a dog
each of his eye be as big as the round tower of copenhagen
but never you mind how fierce he look
just set he on my apron and he'll do you no harm
that suit I say the soldier
but what do you get out of all this you old witch
i suppose that you want your share
no indeed say the witch
i do not want a penny of it
all I ask be for you to fetch I a old tinderbox
my grandmother forget the last time she be down there
good say the soldier
tie the rope around I
here it be say the witch and here be my blue check apron
the soldier climb up to the hole in the tree
he run down into the great hall where the hundred of lamp be burn as the witch have say
he throw open the first door
ugh
there sit a dog glaring at he with eye as big as saucer
you be a nice fellow the soldier say
he shift he to the witch 's apron and take all the copper that his pocket would hold
he shut up the chest set the dog back on it
alas and alack
there sit the dog with eye as big as mill wheel
do not you look at I like that
the soldier set he on the witch 's apron
then he go into the third room
oh what a horrible sight to see
the dog in there really do have eye as big as the round tower
he roll they they spin like wheel
good evening the soldier say and saluted for such a dog he have never see before
but on second glance he think to himself this wont do
so he lifted the dog down to the floor and throw open the chest
what a sight
here be gold and to spare
he can buy out all copenhagen with it
he can buy all the cake all the tin soldier whip and rock horse there be in the world
yes there be really money
yes sir he crammed all his pocket his knapsack his cap and his boot so full
now he be make of money
put the dog back on the chest he bang out the door and call up through the hollow tree
pull I up now you old witch
have you get the tinderbox ask the witch
confound the tinderbox the soldier shout
i clean forget it
when he fetch it the witch hauled he up
there he stand on the highroad again with his pocket boot knapsack and cap full of gold
what do you want with the tinderbox he ask the old witch
none of your business she tell he
you've have your money so hand over my tinder box
nonsense say the soldier
i will not the witch scream at he
so he cut her head off
there she lay
it be a splendid town
he take the good room at the good inn
he order all the good thing he like to eat
next morning he buy boot worthy of he and the good clothes
now that he have turn out to be such a fashionable gentleman
where can I see she the soldier inquired
you can not see she at all everyone say
she live in a great copper castle inside all sort of wall and tower
i'd like to see she just the same the soldier think
but there be no way to manage it
now he live a merry life
but he spend money every day
he have to quit his fine quarter to live in a garret
none of his friend come to see he
one evening he sit in the dark without even enough money to buy a candle
he suddenly remember the tinder box
it be the one with eye as big as saucer
what be my lord 's command say the dog
what be this say the soldier
have I get the sort of tinder box that will get I whatever I want
go get I some money he order the dog
the dog be go
he be back again with a bag full of money in his mouth
now the soldier know what a remarkable tinder box he have
strike it once and there be the dog from the chest of copper coin
strike it twice and here come the dog who have the silver
three time bring the dog who guard gold
back go the soldier to his comfortable quarter
the soldier strode in fashionable clothes
immediately his friend know he again because they like he so much
then the thought occur to he be not it odd that no one ever get to see the princess
why can not I see she
where be my tinder box
he strike the tinderbox and come the dog with eye as big as saucer
it certainly be late say the soldier
practically midnight
but I do want a glimpse of the princess if only for a moment
out the door go the dog and the dog come with the princess on his back
she be sound asleep and so pretty that everyone can see she be a princess
the soldier can not keep from kiss she because he be every inch a soldier
then the dog take the princess home
next morning when the king and queen be drink their tea the princess tell they about the strange dream
she'd ride on the dog 's back and the soldier have kiss she
now that be a fine story say the queen
but the old lady pull on her storm boot and run right after they
then she go home to bed and before long the dog bring the princess home too
but when the dog saw that cross mark on the soldier 's front door
he get himself a piece of chalk and cross-mark every door in the town
here it be say the king when he saw the first cross mark
no my dear
there it be say the queen who be look next door
here 's one there have one and another one say they all
wherever they look they saw chalk mark so they give up search
she take her big gold scissors cut out a piece of silk and make a neat little bag
she fill it with fine buckwheat flour and tie it on to the princess 's back
so in the morning it be all too plain to the king and queen just where their daughter have be
they take the soldier and they put he in prison
it be dark and it be dismal and they tell he
tomorrow be the day for you to hang
he hear the drum beat and he saw the soldier march
in the crowd of run person he saw a shoemaker 's boy in a leather apron and slippers
nothing can happen till I get there
but if you run to where I live and bring I my tinder box i'll give you four copper
the shoemaker 's boy rush the tinder box to the soldier
outside the town a high gallows have be build
around it stand soldier and many hundred thousand person
the king and queen sit on a splendid throne opposite the judge and the whole council
his last word before execution of penalty of a criminal violation of the tradition
he want to smoke a pipe of tobacco
the king can not refuse he so the soldier strike fire from his tinder box once-twice-and a third time
help I
save I from hang say the soldier
the person shout soldier be our king and marry the pretty princess
so they put the soldier in the king 's carriage
all three of his dog dance in front of it
the boy whistle through their finger and the soldier saluted
the princess come out of the copper castle to be queen
the dim roar of london be like the bourdon note of a distant organ
it be your good work Basil the good thing you have ever do say lord Henry languidly
you must certainly send it next year to the grosvenor
the academy be too large and too vulgar
the grosvenor be really the only place
not send it anywhere
my dear fellow why
have you any reason
what odd chaps you painter be
i know you will laugh at I he reply but I really can not exhibit it
i have put too much of myself into it
lord Henry stretch himself out on the divan and laugh
yes I know you would but it be quite true all the same
too much of yourself in it
why my dear Basil he be a narcissus and youwellof course you have a intellectual expression and all that
but beauty real beauty end where a intellectual expression begin
intellect be in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroy the harmony of any face
the moment one sit down to think one become all nose or all forehead or something horrid
look at the successful man in any of the learn profession how perfectly hideous they be
except of course in the church but then in the church they do not think
your mysterious young friend whose name you have never tell I but whose picture really fascinates I never think
i feel quite sure of that
do not flatter yourself Basil you be not in the least like he
you do not understand I Harry answer the artist of course I be not like he
i know that perfectly well
indeed I should be sorry to look like he
you shrug your shoulder
i be tell you the truth
it be good not to be different from one 's fellow
the ugly and the stupid have the good of it in this world
they can sit at their ease and gape at the play
if they know nothing of victory they be at least spare the knowledge of defeat
they live as we all should live undisturbedindifferent and without disquiet
they neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it from alien hand
Dorian grey
be that his name ask lord Henry walk across the studio towards Basil Hallward
yes that be his name
i do not intend to tell it to you
but why not
oh I can not explain
when I like person immensely I never tell their name to anyone
it be like surrender a part of they
i have grow to love secrecy
it seem to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to we
the common thing be delightful if one only hide sit
when I leave town now I never tell my person where I be go
if I do I would lose all my pleasure
i suppose you think I awfully foolish about it
not at all answer lord Henry not at all my dear Basil
i never know where my wife be and my wife never know what I be do
my wife be very good at itmuch good in fact than I be
she never get confuse over her date and I always do
but when she do find I out she make no row at all
i sometimes wish she would but she merely laugh at I
you be a extraordinary fellow
you never say a moral thing and you never do a wrong thing
your cynicism be simply a pose
the sunlight slip over the polish leave
in the grass white daisy be tremulous
after a pause lord Henry pull out his watch
what be that say the painter keep his eye fix on the ground
you know quite well
i do not Harry
well I will tell you what it be
i want you to explain to I why you will not exhibit Dorian grey 's picture
i want the real reason
i tell you the real reason
no you do not
you say it be because there be too much of yourself in it
now that be childish
lord Henry laugh
and what be that he ask
i will tell you say Hallward but a expression of perplexity come over his face
i be all expectation Basil continue his companion glance at he
oh there be really very little to tell harryanswered the painter and I be afraid you will hardly understand it
perhaps you will hardly believe it
lord Henry smile and lean down pluck a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examine it
lord Henry feel as if he can hear Basil Hallward 's heart beat and wonder what be come
i turn halfway round and saw Dorian grey for the first time
when our eye meet I feel that I be grow pale
i do not want any external influence in my life
you know yourself Harry how independent I be by nature
i have always be my own master have at least always be so till I meet Dorian grey
then but I do not know how to explain it to you
something seem to tell I that I be on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life
i have a strange feel that fate have in store for I exquisite joy and exquisite sorrow
i grow afraid and turn to quit the room
it be not conscience that make I do so it be a sort of cowardice
i take no credit to myself for try to escape
conscience and cowardice be really the same thing Basil
conscience be the trade-name of the firm that be all
i do not believe that Harry and I do not believe you do either
there of course I stumbled against lady brandon
'you be not go to run away so soon Hallward' she scream out
you know she curiously shrill voice
i can not get rid of she
suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality have so strangely stir I
we be quite close almost touch
our eye meet again
it be reckless of I but I ask lady brandon to introduce I to he
i be sure of that
Dorian tell I so afterwards
he too feel that we be destined to know each other
i simply flee
i like to find out person for myself
poor lady brandon
you be hard on she Harry say hall ward listlessly
my dear fellow she try to found a salon and only succeed in open a restaurant
how can I admire she
but tell I what do she say about Dorian grey
oh something like charming boypoor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable
quite forget what he doesafraid he do not do anythingoh yes play the pianoor be it the violindear grey
neither of we can help laugh and we become friend at once
Hallward shake his head
you do not understand what friendship be Harry he murmuredor what enmity be for that matter
you like everyone that be to say you be indifferent to everyone
i make a great difference between person
they be all man of some intellectual power and consequently they all appreciate I
be that very vain of I
i think it be rather vain
i should think it be Harry
but according to your category I must be merely a acquaintance
my dear old Basil you be much more than a acquaintance
and much less than a friend
a sort of brother I suppose
oh brother
i do not care for brother
my elder brother wo not die and my young brother seem never to do anything else
Harry exclaim Hallward frown
my dear fellow I be not quite serious
but I can not help detest my relation
i quite sympathise with the rage of the english democracy against what they call the vice of the upper order
when poor southwark get into the divorce courttheir indignation be quite magnificent
and yet I do not suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly
lord Henry stroke his point brown beard and tap the toe of his patent-leather boot with a tassel ebony cane
how english you be Basil
that be the second time you have make that observation
the only thing he consider of any importance be whether one believe it oneself
now the value of a idea have nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who express it
however I do not propose to discuss politicssociology or metaphysics with you
i like person good than principle and I like person with no principle good than anything else in the world
tell I more about Dorian grey
how often do you see he
every day
i can not be happy if I do not see he every day
he be absolutely necessary to I
how extraordinary
i think you would never care for anything but your art
it be not merely that I paint from he draw from himsketch from he
of course I have do all that
but he be much more to I than a model or a sitter
i see thing differently I think of they differently
i can now recreate life in a way that be hide from I before
'a dream of form in day of thought'who be it who say that
i forget but it be what Dorian grey have be to I
the harmony of soul and bodyhow much that be
Harry if you only know what Dorian grey be to I
it be one of the good thing I have ever do
and why be it so
because while I be paint it Dorian grey sit beside I
Basil this be extraordinary
i must see Dorian grey
Hallward get up from the seat and walk up and down the garden
after some time he come back
Harry he say Dorian grey be to I simply a motive in art
you might see nothing in he I see everything in he
he be never more present in my work than when no image of he be there
he be a suggestion as I have say of a new manner
i find he in the curve of certain line in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colour
that be all
then why will not you exhibit his portrait ask lord Henry
he shall never know anything about it
my heart shall never be put under their microscope
there be too much of myself in the thing harrytoo much of myself
poet be not so scrupulous as you be
they know how useful passion be for publication
nowadays a break heart will run to many edition
we live in a age when man treat art as if it be mean to be a form of autobiography
we have lose the abstract sense of beauty
i think you be wrong Basil but I will not argue with you
it be only the intellectually lose who ever argue
tell I be Dorian grey very fond of you
the painter consider for a few moment
he like I he answer after a pause i know he like I
of course I flatter he dreadfully
i find a strange pleasure in saying thing to he that I know I shall be sorry for have say
as a rule he be charming to I and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand thing
now and then however he be horribly thoughtlessand seem to take a real delight in give I pain
day in summer Basil be apt to linger murmur lord Henry perhaps you will tyre sooner than he will
it be a sad thing to think of but there be no doubt that genius last long than beauty
that account for the fact that we all take such pain to over-educate ourselves
the thoroughly well-inform manthat be the modern ideal
and the mind of the thoroughly well-inform man be a dreadful thing
it be like a bric-??-brac shop all monster and dustwith everything price above its proper value
i think you will tyre first all the same
you will bitterly reproach he in your own heartand seriously think that he have behaved very badly to you
the next time he call you will be perfectly cold and indifferent
it will be a great pity for it will alter you
Harry do not talk like that
as long as I live the personality of Dorian grey will dominate I
you can not feel what I feel you change too often
ah my dear Basil that be exactly why I can feel it
how pleasant it be in the garden
it be charming to have escape all that
as he think of his aunt a idea seem to strike he
he turn to Hallward and say
my dear fellow I have just remember
remember what Harry
where I hear the name of Dorian grey
where be it ask Hallward with a slight frown
do not look so angry Basil
it be at my aunt lady agatha 's
i be bind to state that she never tell I he be good-look
woman have no appreciation of good look at leastgood woman have not
i wish I have know it be your friend
i be very glad you do not Harry
why
i do not want you to meet he
you do not want I to meet he
no
Dorian grey be in the studio sir say the butler come into the garden
you must introduce I now cry lord Henry laugh
the painter turn to his servant who stand blink in the sunlight
ask grey to wait parker I shall be in in a few moment
the man bow and go up the walk
then he look at lord Henry
do not spoil he
do not try to influence he
your influence would be bad
the world be wide and have many marvel lo we person in it
mind Harry I trust you
he speak very slowly and the word seem wrung out of he almost against his will

great prince vsevolod will you not fly in thought from afar to watch your father golden throne
for you can empty the volga with oar you pour out the don with your helmet
if only you be here a slave girl would sell for a pittance and a captive for less
for you can shoot across dry land with your live fire your brave son of gleb
and you wild riurik and david be you not the one who swim with golden helmet in blood
be it not your brave retinue that roar like wild bull wound by temper sabre on the unknown steppe

i have live long in holland pursue my study at leyden and I speak dutch well
the seaman soon know whence I come last they be curious to inquire into my voyage and course of life
i make up a story as short and probable as I can but conceal the great part
nothing happen worth mention in this voyage
from amsterdam I soon after set sail for england in a small vessel belong to that city
on the sixteenth of april we put in at the downs
he travel up into the country
the yahoo a strange sort of animal describe
the author meet two houyhnhnm
i tell they i be their prisoner and would submit
they send I own victuals and drink and take the government of the ship to themselves
their design be to turn pirate and plunder the spaniards which they can not do till they get more man
i expostulated with he but in vain neither would he so much as tell I who their new captain be
they row about a league and then set I down on a strand
i desire they to tell I what country it be
at last I behold several animal in a field and one or two of the same kind sit in tree
some of they come forward near the place where I lay give I a opportunity of distinctly mark their form
they would often spring and bind and leap with prodigious agility
the hair of both sex be of several colour brown red black and yellow
the two horse come up close to I look with great earnestness upon my face and hand
the author conduct by a houyhnhnm to his house
the house describe
the author reception
the food of the houyhnhnm
the author in distress for want of meat be at last relieve
his manner of feed in this country
the grey come in just after and thereby prevent any ill treatment which the others might have give I
he neigh to they several time in a style of authority and receive answer
we go through the second room towards the third
but that a man of quality should be serve all by horse be beyond my comprehension
i fear my brain be disturb by my suffering and misfortune
i rub my eye often but the same object still occur
i pinch my arm and side to awake myself hope I might be in a dream
i then absolutely conclude that all this appearance can be nothing else but necromancy and magic
this the master horse observe by my behaviour and therefore send the yahoo back to his kennel
about noon I saw come towards the house a kind of vehicle draw like a sledge by four yahoo
he come to dine with our horse who receive he with great civility
oats in their tongue be call hlunnh
and I can not but observe that I never have one hour sickness while I stay in this island
here I get some straw and covering myself with my own clothes sleep very sound
the author study to learn the language
the houyhnhnm his master assist in teaching he
the language describe
several houyhnhnm of quality come out of curiosity to see the author
he give his master a short account of his voyage
in this employment a sorrel nag one of the under-servant be very ready to assist I
this last after some time I ventured to do in my master presence
it be with some difficulty and by the help of many sign that I bring he to understand I
he be sure no houyhnhnm alive can make such a vessel nor would trust yahoo to manage it
the word houyhnhnm in their tongue signify a horse and in its etymology the perfection of nature
this delighted to converse with I they put many question and receive such answer as I be able to return
whereupon I first unbuttoned my coat and pull it off I do the same with my waistcoat
my master observe the whole performance with great sign of curiosity and admiration
the houyhnhnm notion of truth and falsehood
the author discourse disapprove by his master
the author give a more particular account of himself and the accident of his voyage
to return from this digression
but he insist in command I to let he know the good and the bad
i tell he he should be obey
during this discourse my master be please to interrupt I several time
this labour take up several day conversation before he be able to comprehend I
he be wholly at a loss to know what can be the use or necessity of practise that vice
all this I be force to define and describe by put case and make supposition
the author at his master command inform he of the state of england
the cause of war among the prince of europe
the author begin to explain the english constitution
he ask I what be the usual cause or motive that make one country go to war with another
i answer they be innumerable but I should only mention a few of the chief
i can not forbear shake my head and smile a little at his ignorance
i be go on to more particular when my master command I silence
he add that he have hear too much upon the subject of war both in this and some former discourse
there be another point which a little perplexed he at present
and therefore I have but two method to preserve my cow
a continuation of the state of england under queen anne
the character of a first minister of state in european court
he say that must need be a miserable country which can not furnish food for its own inhabitant
there be three method by which a man may rise to be chief minister
his master observation upon the constitution and administration of england as describe by the author with parallel case and comparison
his master observation upon human nature
but it be decree by fortune my perpetual enemy that so great a felicity should not fall to my share
i do indeed observe that the yahoo be the only animal in this country subject to any disease
and the cure prescribe be a mixture of their own dung and urine forcibly put down the yahoo throat
he usually continue in office till a bad can be found
both which practice be such degree of infamous brutality as no other sensitive creature ever arrive at
my master likewise mention another quality which his servant have discover in several yahoo and to he be wholly unaccountable
the author relate several particular of the yahoo
the great virtue of the houyhnhnm
the education and exercise of their youth
their general assembly
they be prodigiously nimble from their infancy
and upon this occasion I hope the reader will pardon my relate a odd adventure
he consent and I immediately strip myself stark naked and go down softly into the stream
i be never in my life so terribly frighten
the nag be graze at some distance not suspect any harm
this be a matter of diversion to my master and his family as well as of mortification to myself
so that controversy wranglings dispute and positiveness in false or dubious proposition be evil unknown among the houyhnhnm
for a stranger from the remotest part be equally treat with the near neighbour
and wherever he go look upon himself as at home
they preserve decency and civility in the high degree but be altogether ignorant of ceremony
and I observe my master to show the same affection to his neighbour issue that he have for his own
this caution be necessary to prevent the country from being overburden with number
courtship love present jointures settlement have no place in their thought or term whereby to express they in their language
in educate the youth of both sex their method be admirable and highly deserve our imitation
where the victor be reward with a song in his or her praise
and wherever there be any want which be but seldom it be immediately supply by unanimous consent and contribution
here likewise the regulation of child be settle
as for instance
a grand debate at the general assembly of the houyhnhnm and how it be determine
the learn of the houyhnhnm
their building
their manner of burial
the defectiveness of their language
in this council be resume their old debate and indeed the only debate that ever happen in their country
whereof my master after his return give I a very particular account
the question to be debate be whether the yahoo should be exterminate from the face of the earth
one of the member for the affirmative offer several argument of great strength and weight allege
he take notice of a general tradition that yahoo have not be always in their country
but that many age ago two of this brute appear together upon a mountain
that in the mean time the houyhnhnm should be exhort to cultivate the breed of ass
this be all my master think fit to tell I at that time of what pass in the grand council
but he be please to conceal one particular which relate personally to myself whereof I soon feel the unhappy effect
as the reader will know in its proper place
and whence I date all the succeed misfortune of my life
the houyhnhnm have no letter and consequently their knowledge be all traditional
they calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and moon but use no subdivision into week
they be well enough acquaint with the motion of that two luminaries and understand the nature of eclipse
and this be the utmost progress of their astronomy
the roof be make after the same manner and so be the door
they milk their cow reap their oats and do all the work which require hand in the same manner
they make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessel and bake the former in the sun
she die about three month after
they live generally to seventy or seventy-five year very seldom to fourscore
some week before their death they feel a gradual decay but without pain
for instance hhnm Yahoo whnahalm Yahoo ynlhmndwihlma yahoo and a ill-contrive house ynhalmhnmrohlnw yahoo
and in the mean time proceed to relate my own sad catastrophe chapter x
the author economy and happy life among the houyhnhnm
his great improvement in virtue by converse with they
their conversation
the author have notice give he by his master that he must depart from the country
he fall into a swoon for grief but submit
he contrive and finish a canoe by the help of a fellow-servant and put to sea at a venture
i have settle my little economy to my own heart content
my master have order a room to be make for I after their manner about six yard from the house
the side and floor of which I plaster with clay and cover with rush-mat of my own contrive
i have beat hemp which there grow wild and make of it a sort of ticking
i have work two chair with my knife the sorrel nag help I in the gross and more laborious part
i often get honey out of hollow tree which I mingle with water or eat with my bread
both he and his company would often descend to ask I question and receive my answer
i have also sometimes the honour of attend my master in his visit to others
which however I take for a great compliment
that such a practice be not agreeable to reason or nature or a thing ever hear of before among they
i be not ignorant how much I have be censured for mention this last particular
neither have I forget how apt some traveller be to boast of extraordinary favour they have receive
the author dangerous voyage
he arrive at new holland hope to settle there
be wound with a arrow by one of the native
be seize and carry by force into a portuguese ship
the great civility of the captain
the author arrive at england
i begin this desperate voyage on february at nine oclock in the morning
it be nothing but a rock with one creek naturally arch by the force of tempests
they be stark naked man woman and child round a fire as I can discover by the smoke
i make what haste I can to the shore and get into my canoe shoved off
one of the seaman in portuguese bid I rise and ask
i think it good to comply with their proposal
however I remain silent and sullen I be ready to faint at the very smell of he and his man
at last I desire something to eat out of my own canoe
but one of the seaman prevent I and have inform the captain I be chain to my cabin
after dinner don pedro come to I and desire to know my reason for so desperate a attempt
our voyage pass without any considerable accident
but the great part of the day I confine myself to my cabin to avoid see any of the crew
this I change every second day and wash they myself
we arrive at lisbon november
he accoutred I with other necessaries all new which I air for twenty-four hour before I would use they
he gain so far upon I that I ventured to look out of the back window
I complied at last find I can not do good
don pedro accompany I to the ship and lend I twenty pound
he take kind leave of I and embrace I at part which I bore as well as I can
at the time I be write it be five year since my last return to england
my horse understand I tolerably well I converse with they at least four hour every day
the author veracity
his design in publish this work
his censure of that traveller who swerve from the truth
the author clear himself from any sinister end in write
a objection answer
the method of plant colony
his native country commended
the right of the crown to that country describe by the author be justify
the difficulty of conquer they
but I forbear descanting far and rather leave the judicious reader to his own remark and application
i be not a little please that this work of mine can possibly meet with no censurers
i have carefully avoid every fault with which common writer of travel be often too justly charge
so that I hope I may with justice pronounce myself a author perfectly blameless
however suppose myself to be a minister of state I can never give my advice for invade they
for they would well deserve the character give to augustus recalcitrat undique tutus
which I be able to assert from my own small reading
but I have another reason which make I less forward to enlarge his majesty dominion by my discovery
ship be send with the first opportunity the native drive out or destroy
but I who have more experience can plainly observe some rudiments of it among the wild yahoo
domestic be connect with home
once Dauren ask the parrot
Kuzya can you tell I the difference between domestic animal and wild animal
try to guess
Dauren begin to think
domestic animal have a owner and wild animal do not
well it be right - Kuzya compliment the boy and add
i have want for a long time to invite you to my friend house in the village
Vitalik add
to our friend
the parrot pretend not to hear
so my friend have a big farm with cow sheep horse and pig
there we will meet domestic animal see how they live and learn new word at the same time
look at this little kid Kuzya point at a kid
ooh and where be its mum
such little baby should not be away from their parent Lilian shake her head
let go and find its mum then - suggest Vitalik
we neednt look for she
there she be little Nick point at a sheep
she be as white as her baby
so she be its mother
everybody laugh
but Nick take offense and frown
Nick you be wrong nicks sister hugged he
look
our kid have little horn
and his mother the goat must have big horn
you have find a sheep and sheep have their own baby call lamb
so every baby have its own mother
and every mother have her own baby
dont mix they up
you will never take our mum for anybody else wont you
so keep your eye open and try to remember evething
poultry yard
the friend like very much to stay at vitaliks and kuzyas pal
the hostess offer they fresh milk let they ride a horse and play with kid
the child decide to stay at the farm one more day
in the morning the kid be wake up by a cock that shout to Kuzya
hey parrot come out quickly the sun be rise
Kuzya wake up and begin to call his friend
hey lazy-bone get up to see the sun
Nick try to hide under the pillow but Kuzya find he and start to pinch his heel
he do so to Sauran who also uked to sleep
Vitalik try to hush the parrot
kuzay why do you make we get up so early
because today we will have our lesson at the poultry yard
folks get up very early there - with a cock-crow - even chicken do so
zoo
once Lilian come to the lesson without Nick
where be your brother - ask Kuzya - be he sick
even bad - say Lilian angrily
Nick say he would be a great hunter when grow up
so what - the brother get astonish
what do you mean so what
he be go to hunt lion and tiger and also antelope giraffe and crocodile
i do not want it
i do not want this animal to disappear from the face of the earth because of my brother
Lilian do not be angry with your brother - Vitalik ask the girl
he be just a little boy - Kuzya come to nicks defence
we will go to the zoo today
i think that after he meet animal there he will never want to kill they
and so it happen
they be call wild animal wild animal live in forest and desert in cold and hot country
the parrot - a bird of freedom
autumn be come soon - say Sauran sadly
bird will fly to the south
it must be good there in the jungle - groan Kuzya - and warm
i live there - say the parrot proudly
ill be a absolutely wild and free bird
dont you like being with we - Vitalik get upset
- have we hurt you somehow
no you have not - answer the parrot
you have be a good master but freedom be the good tile a bird can have
the whole sky and earth belong to you
and today we will talk about free bird that can fly wherever they want
